This repository hosts the UI project for the {url-docs-playbook}[documentation playbook].

TIP: You can see the UI in action on the {url-docs}[documentation site].

== GitHub Actions

To automate some elements of the build process, this repository includes the following GitHub Actions:

.GitHub Actions
[cols="m,a,a"]
|===
|File |Description |Triggers

|bundle.yml
|link:{url-contributing}#package[Packages the UI] into a `ui-bundle.zip` file and commits it to the `master` branch
|On a push to the `master` branch of this repository

== Custom CSS classes
The UI supports adding custom CSS classes to various elements of the documentation site.

=== `.multiple-headed-table`
Use this class on tables that have multiple header rows to ensure proper styling. Apply the class to the table element as shown below:

[source=asciidoc]
----
  [.multiple-headed-table, cols="x,x,x" ...]
  |===
  |[align=left]*Core Hazelcast Capabilities*
  |[align=left]*Hey*
  |[align=left]*Hi*
  |[align=left]*Description*

  |Management Center
  |✅
  |❌
  |Get full access to all Management Center features.

  |*Management Center*
  |*Foo*
  |*Bar*
  |*Get full access to all Management Center features.*

  |===
----

The last column in the example above will be styled correctly as a header row since it contains bold text.

=== `.img-inline-block`
Use this class on inline image elements to display them as inline-block elements, allowing text to wrap around them on bigger screens (> 1600px) but showing them as block elements on smaller screens. Apply the class to the image element as shown below:

[source=asciidoc]
----
  [.img-inline-block]
